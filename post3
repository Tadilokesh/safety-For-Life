<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->

<h2>Traffic and Road Safety Issues</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is true that both the authorities and the road users are totally informed about the need for enhanced road safety and traffic awareness. Still, there are many traffic safety issues in India.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Negligence of Civilians:</strong>&nbsp;It’s true that the civilians make the most hue and cry about the road safety issues. Still, however, the same people can be often seen not respecting the traffic rules. This is something that is quite worrying as they take rules lightly even after knowing that breaking the road safety rules is dangerous.</li><li><strong>Poor Condition of roads:&nbsp;</strong>Another huge road safety issue that we face is that of poor infrastructure. Poor road designs and badly maintained roads often lead to mishaps. They also take a toll on the vehicles. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Unsafe Vehicle Design:&nbsp;</strong>It is not uncommon to see Indian manufacturers not paying as much importance to the safety quotient of their vehicles as they do on vehicles they sell in the west. It’s important to look into this urgently and come up with a solution.</li><li><strong>Under-implementation of Road Safety Standards:&nbsp;</strong>At times, the required road signs or markings are missing, which is something that should be corrected at the earliest.</li><li><strong>Indifferent Government:</strong>&nbsp;Lack of proper planning by the government often leads to motorists suffering from poor road safety standards. It has also been seen that the contractors who offer at least 10 years of warranty on their projects abroad make sub-standard roads in India that get washed away in monsoon.</li><li><strong>Lack of proper law enforcement’s:</strong>&nbsp;Having laws is one thing and their enforcement is something other. While proper laws are already in place, the need of the hour is to implement them to the fullest.</li><li><strong>Lack of Emergency Services:</strong>&nbsp;Often, some of our roads lack emergency services and in case of an accident, a quick response team is simply not available. Often, the victim succumbs to his injuries by the time he is taken to a hospital.</li></ul>
